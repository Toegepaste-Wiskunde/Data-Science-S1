    "\n",
    "Here is how it works (examples are numbered below):\n",
    "1. You can run (execute) a cell by selecting it and either clicking `Run` in the toolbar or pressing `Shift-Enter`.\n",
    "2. There may be a cell that does not start with `%%`. Run that cell first. This could be an example that demonstrates how something works, or for an asignment some code that we provide to setup something you need to do the assignent.\n",
    "3. Next, there could be a cell that starts wil %%assignment. You have to fill in your code below the %%assignment and run the cell. If you get an error or the answer is not what you think it should be, you can change the code and run the second cell again.\n",
    "4. Or you could have a cell that starts with `%%` and something else. These are often cells that generate a multiple choice question. Run the cell and answer the question\n",
    "5. Then you see a cell containing `%%check`. This cell automatically checks your answer, provides feedback and helps to grade your work. Don't pay too much attention to what is in that cell, rather focus on the assignment itself. And don't change the contents of this cell, because then you cannot submit it anymore to receive a grade.\n",
    "6. If you get it right you will see a green `Correct!` sign. Well done! \n",
    "7. If you get it wrong, try to change your solution in the second cell, run the second cell again and then the third cell again."

The objective here is not to get answers correctly, because you can try as often as you want, but rather take a moment and think about why that is the correct answer! It's about learning after all."

    "- don't get behind on the lecture schedule!\n",
    "- we encourage you to add your own notes and experiments in these notebooks. You can add a cell from the menu and this will not affect the autograding for the notebook. You can change the cell type to `Markdown` to enter text. Google a Markdown tutorial to see how you can markup your text, you can even write formulas in Latex.\n",
