    "Computer programs can sometimes run into Errors or Exceptions. An 'Exception' is a condition that prevents your program from continuing its normal execution. An Error is usually slightly more severe and may indicate something has gone terribly wrong (which is not always the case). For example, `a = 1 / 0` will throw a `ZeroDivisionError`. Since this does not result in a real value, the program cannot assign a value to `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Exceptions and Errors remain unhandled, they result in termination of the program. You have probably seen so-called 'Tracebacks' that indicate which line threw an Error or Exception and recursively the lines that called the function in which the Exception appeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not always possible to handle an Exception. For instance, when the program needs to read a file but somehow it cannot, there may be no way around that and the user should be informed so that the cause may be removed. However, sometimes we can deal with Exception programmatically, so that the program is more likely to finish with a valid result."
